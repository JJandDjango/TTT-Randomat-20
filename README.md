# ULX Support
This version of the Randomat 2.0 should be compatible with all versions of the ULX Module for Randomat 2.0
That being said, I have created my [own version of the ULX Module](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2096758509) which supports these new events as well as dynamic event loading with little-to-no developer interaction
